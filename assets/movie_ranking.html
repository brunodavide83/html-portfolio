<h3>The Godfather Part One  </h3>
<p>The Godfather <p>" Vito Corleone is the head of the Corleone mafia family in New York. He is at the event of his daughter's wedding.</p>
 Michael, Vito's youngest son and a decorated WW II Marine is also present at the wedding.</p>

 Michael seems to be uninterested in being a part of the family business. 
 Vito is a powerful man, and is kind to all those who give him respect but is ruthless against those who do not. </p>

 But when a powerful and treacherous rival wants to sell drugs and needs the Don's influence for the same, Vito refuses to do it. </p>

 What follows is a clash between Vito's fading old values and the new ways which may cause Michael to do the thing he was most reluctant 
 in doing and wage a mob war against all the other mafia families which could tear the Corleone family apart."</p>

<h3>The Shawshank Redemption</h3>
<p>Chronicles the experiences of a formerly successful banker as a prisoner in the gloomy jailhouse of Shawshank 
    after being found guilty of a crime he did not commit. 
    <p>The film portrays the man's unique way of dealing with his new, 
    torturous life; along the way he befriends a number of fellow prisoners, most notably a wise long-term inmate named Red.</p>
<h3>Goodfellas</h3>
<p>Henry Hill might be a small time gangster, who may have taken part in a robbery with Jimmy Conway and Tommy De Vito, 
    two other gangsters who might have set their sights a bit higher.
 </p> two partners could kill off everyone else involved in the robbery, 
    and slowly start to think about climbing up through the hierarchy of the Mob. Henry, however, might be badly affected by his partners' success, 
    but will he consider stooping low enough to bring about the downfall of Jimmy and Tommy?</p>
