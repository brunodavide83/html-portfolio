<h1>About Me</h1>

<p> A seasoned professional in the food and beverage industry, I bring over 18 years of extensive experience in managing high-end restaurants, ensuring top-notch customer service, and mastering the art of culinary excellence.
</p> While my career has been rooted in hospitality, my passion for technology and innovation has led me to pursue a new path in the tech industry. 
With a keen interest in software development and a commitment to lifelong learning, 
I am eager to embrace the challenges of a junior software engineering role, where I can apply my 
problem-solving skills, attention to detail, and customer-centric approach.</p>
